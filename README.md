# Latin Prefixed Verbs - GitHub Pages website

My first website published via GitHub Pages - a repository with a single HTML file.

Site is published [here](https://jnfischer.github.io/latin-prefixed-verbs/prefixedverbs.md.html).

I generated the HTML file offline via Atom's Markdown Preview Plus extension. A natural next step is to use a static site generator (e.g. Jekyll, Hugo) so that the repo contains the Markdown source file and the SSG renders the HTML from the source file using a customizable visual theme.
