# Latin Prefixed Verbs - GitHub Pages website

My first website published via GitHub Pages - a repository with a single Markdown file.

Site is published [here](https://jnfischer.github.io/latin-prefixed-verbs/prefixedverbs.html). GitHub Pages automatially converts the Markdown source to HTML.

A natural next step is to use a static site generator (e.g. Jekyll, Hugo) to render the HTML from the source file using a customizable visual theme.
