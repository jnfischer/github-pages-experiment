# Latin Prefixed Verbs As Seen in English

by John Fischer

## Introduction

Latin employs prefixing to allow the production of words with additional shades of meaning; this is especially prominent in verbs. Many prefixed verbs have even taken on new shades of meaning beyond what would be implied solely by the root and prefix. This 'grid' of prefixed root verbs, with its thousands of distinct meanings, has been inherited (and often also partially reborrowed) by the Romance languages. The English language, having borrowed extensively from French and Latin, has also come to rely on the Latin prefixed verb system for a significant portion of its vocabulary.

Wanting to learn more about the manner in which Latin prefixed verbs appear in English, I searched online but had little luck finding what I was looking for:

- A reasonably _thorough_ visualization of the grid of verbs and prefixes – not just cherry-picking some root verbs and prefixes to yield a tidy table, but rather a table incorporating larger lists of prominent root verbs and prefixes so that the natural distribution of prefix-root combinations is plainly visible.
- A _ranking_ of prefixes by some measure, however rough or approximate, of the _popularity_ of each prefix – or put another way, of the _frequency_ with which each prefix is combined with root verbs.

Over the span of a couple months, I cultivated a table of English words originating from Latin prefixed verbs. If I encountered a new root, I used Wiktionary to find its various prefixed forms; and if I encountered a new prefix, I used Wiktionary to find root verbs to which the prefix was applicable.

To keep the table's size manageable, for the most part I favored including only root verbs that accept more than one prefix. Eventually the table's size stabilized at about 20 prefixes and 40 root verbs, and the prefixes could be meaningfully ranked by the number of words present in the table for each prefix – a rough yet useful measure of popularity.

## The table

The rows of this table are Latin verbs sorted alphabetically, with each verb identified by its first [principal part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_parts#Latin).

- By convention, for most Latin verbs the first principal part is the conjugated form for indicative [mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood), active [voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_%28grammar%29), present [tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense#Latin_and_Ancient_Greek), singular [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number), and first [person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person). However, one of the verbs appearing below, **gradior**, is [deponent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deponent_verb#Latin) and not conjugated into active-voice forms; **gradior** is the indicative _passive_ present first-person singular form.
- The verb **fero** is given two rows because it is a [_suppletive verb_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppletion) – a portion of its conjugated forms originate from an entirely different verb (as with English **go**, **went**). The **fero**-cognate forms appear in row '**fero (i)**', while forms cognate to the suppletive principal part **latum** appear in row '**fero (ii)**'.

The columns of this table are Latin prefixes. The prefixes are sorted first by the number of words appearing in the column (roughly gauging the _popularity_ of the prefix), and second alphabetically.

- The most popular prefixes (with Wiktionary link for each): [_con-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/con-#Latin), [_ad-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ad-#Latin), [_in-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in-#Latin), [_re-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/re-#Latin), [_ex-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ex-#Latin), [_de-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/de-#Latin)

- Prefixes of intermediate popularity: [_dis-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dis-#Latin), [_sub-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sub-#Latin), [_prae-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prae-#Latin), [_pro-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pro-#Latin), [_ab-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ab-#Latin), [_ob-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ob-#Latin), [_per-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/per-#Latin), [_trans-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trans-#Latin) (no Wiktionary entry for prefix), [_se-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/se-#Latin)

- Other less popular prefixes, omitted to keep the size of the table more manageable: [_inter-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inter-#Latin), [_ante-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ante-#Latin), [_ne-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ne-#Latin), [_circum-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/circum-#Latin), [_intro-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intro-#Latin)

If the Latin verb resulting from combining a given prefix and root verb serves as the source for a (reasonably well-known) English word, that word appears in the relevant cell. Words that are also verbs in English have been favored when possible.

## Future ideas

Verb prefixing is also prominent in German; it should be reasonably straightforward to create a similar table for German. It could be useful to distinguish [separable verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_verb) from non-separable verbs in such an analysis.

English also has many prefixed verbs of Germanic origin, and these could be organized in table form as has been done here. However, English also has an extensive collection of [_phrasal verbs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_verb), in which a verb and an accompanying word – generally a preposition or adverb – together carry a unique shade of meaning (e.g. **run up**, **pull off**). A table of English phrasal verbs illustrating which accompanying words (**up**, **off**, etc.) are most 'popular' would be fascinating to examine.

The Latin prefixes, German prefixes, and English phrasal verb accompanying words all tend to have similar functions, and in many cases they are even theorized to have common origins. A comparison of these morphemes across languages is another intriguing area for future study.
